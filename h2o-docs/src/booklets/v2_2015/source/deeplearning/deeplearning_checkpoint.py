# TO DO: After grid is implemented in Python, add this...

# model_chkp <- h2o.deeplearning(x = train.names[0:784], 
#                           y = train.names[785], 
#                           training_frame = train, 
#                           checkpoint = grid@model[[1]],  #need to udpate
#                           validation_frame = test,
#                           epochs = 9)
